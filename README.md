# Input Testing
This software helps me in testing my inputs for contests
It asks the user to either select if his testing input is String or integers: 
If the user entered S, this means that the data will be entered to the compiler is String type 
and 
If the user selected any other letters, this means that the data will entered is integer type

If the user identified the inputing data as String, the user will be asked about the number of the tests, if only specefic charchters needed and if there is a maximum size of every word the user needs.

If the user identified the inputing data as Integer, the user will be asked about the number of the tests and after this a random number will be used.

The purpose of this program to help the user generate input can be used in testing his program and the algorithm used.

** The idea of this software was inspired by having challenge in testing my data in HackerCup Facebook contest and I found such a software will be helpful in testing my code in the future **
